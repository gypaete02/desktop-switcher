# desktop-switcher
desktop-switcher is a program written in rust for switching between bspwm desktops conveniently with `alt + tab`. I made this program so that it works for me, but I can't guarantee that it works well for everyone.

## Features
- Switch between recently used desktops conveniently with `alt + tab`
- Switch to specific desktop with `super + 0..9`
- Switch to next/previous desktop with `super + [` / `super + ]`

## Todo
- Better error handling
- Better code readability
